# FizzBuzz
### What is *FizzBuzz*?
*FizzBuzz* is originally a children's exercise in divisibility that peculiarly developed into a weed-out, programming interview question. Children would count from 1 and say "fizz" in place of numbers divisible by 3, "buzz" in place of numbers divisible by 5, and "fizzbuzz" in place of numbers divisible by 3 and 5. Read the wiki on it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).

### How is this exercise translated to computer programming?
In the programming language of interest, the programmer will execute this exercise for all integers from 1 to 100. The interviewee will replace numbers that are divisible by 3 with the word "fizz," replace those divisible by 5 with the word "buzz," replace those divisible by both 3 and 5 with the combination of the two words "fizzbuzz," and print the numbers that meet none of the 3 criteria to the console.

*Example Output*:
```
[1] "1"
[1] "2"
[1] "fizz"
[1] "4"
[1] "buzz"
[1] "fizz"
[1] "7"
[1] "8"
```
