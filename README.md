# FizzBuzz
### What is *FizzBuzz*?
*FizzBuzz* is originally a children's exercise in divisibility that peculiarly developed into a weed-out, programming interview question. 

In the programming language of interest, the coder will replace numbers divisible by 3 with the word "fizz," replace numbers divisible by 5 with the word "buzz," and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with the combination of the two words "fizzbuzz"; hence, *FizzBuzz*. Read the wiki on it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).

The R script included in this repository records my attempt to write the shortest R code to achieve the above goal.
